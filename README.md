# Account API

This is a bank account management API, developed according to the rules:

- To open an account CPF document and name are needed (Customer)
- Only one account per Customer
- Transactions between accounts are valid
- Should not accept account's negative balance
- Each deposit transaction must be less than R$2001
- There are no limits for transactions between accounts, also those are free
